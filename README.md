## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system

### Running the Project

1. **Save all files & folders** in the same directory:
   - `main.py`
   - `library_classes.py`
   - `library_utils.py`
   - `file_operations.py`

2. **Open terminal/command prompt** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/library_tracker
   ```

3. **Run the main program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Expected Output**: The program will run through all demonstrations, showing:
   - Operator demonstrations
   - String operations
   - Loop examples
   - Function demonstrations (map, filter, reduce, zip)
   - OOP examples (creating books, users, library operations)
   - File handling (saving and loading data)

## 📖 What Each File Does

### `main.py`
The main entry point that:
- Imports all modules
- Demonstrates basic Python concepts (data types, operators, strings, loops)
- Integrates all components into a cohesive library system
- Shows how different concepts work together

### `library.py` `book.py` `ebook.py` `user.py`
Contains all Object-Oriented Programming demonstrations:
- **`LibraryItem`**: Abstract base class (polymorphism foundation)
- **`Book`**: Main book class with encapsulation
- **`EBook`**: Inherits from Book (demonstrates inheritance)
- **`User`**: User class with private/protected attributes
- **`PremiumUser`**: Extends User (inheritance and polymorphism)
- **`Library`**: Main library class managing books and users

### `library_utils.py`
Utility functions demonstrating:
- Basic function definitions and calling
- Functions with default parameters, *args, **kwargs
- `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` for functional programming
- `zip()` for combining iterables
- Variable scope (local, global, enclosing, built-in)
- Lambda functions
- Higher-order functions

### `files/ops.py`
File handling and exception handling:
- Reading and writing text files
- CSV file operations
- JSON file operations
- Binary file operations
- try-except-else-finally blocks
- Custom exception classes
- Exception handling best practices

## 🎓 Educational Features

### Inline Comments
Every section has comprehensive comments explaining:
- What the code does
- Why it's written that way
- Which Python concept it demonstrates
- Syntax explanations for beginners

### Progressive Complexity
The code starts simple and gradually introduces more complex concepts:
1. Basic data types and operators
2. Collections and control flow
3. Functions and functional programming
4. Object-oriented programming
5. File handling and error management

### Real-World Application
Rather than isolated examples, the project simulates a real library system:
- Books can be borrowed and returned
- Users have permissions and fines
- Operations are logged to files
- Data can be saved and loaded

## 💡 Key Demonstrations

### Data Structures in Action
```python
# Lists - mutable, ordered
book_titles = ["Python Basics", "Java Guide", "Web Dev"]

# Tuples - immutable, ordered  
book_info = ("Python Crash Course", "Eric Matthes", 2019)

# Sets - unique, unordered
genres = {"Fiction", "Science", "History"}

# Dictionaries - key-value pairs
book = {"id": 101, "title": "Python Guide", "author": "John Doe"}
```

### Object-Oriented Programming
```python
# Creating objects
book = Book(101, "Python Programming", "John Doe", 2023)
user = User("Alice", "alice@email.com", 1001)
library = Library("Python Learning Library")

# Encapsulation - private attributes
print(book.title)  # Uses property getter

# Inheritance
ebook = EBook(102, "Web Dev", "Jane Smith", 2024, 5.2, "PDF")

# Polymorphism - same method, different behavior
print(book.get_info())    # Book-specific output
print(ebook.get_info())   # EBook-specific output
```

### Functional Programming
```python
# Map - transform all items
prices = list(map(lambda book: book['price'], books))

# Filter - select items matching condition
cheap_books = list(filter(lambda book: book['price'] < 30, books))

# Reduce - combine items into single value
total_price = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b['price'], books, 0)

# Zip - combine multiple lists
for id, title, author in zip(book_ids, titles, authors):
    print(f"{id}: {title} by {author}")
```

### Exception Handling
```python
try:
    with open("library_data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied!")
else:
    print("File loaded successfully!")
finally:
    print("Cleanup code here")
```
